# HayPlusbot — Claude Code Phase 3 Build Prompts (v3.4)

**Phase 3: Broker abstraction, account number recording, manual reconciliation**

This document contains four ready-to-paste Claude Code prompts. Phase 3 in v3.4 is shorter than v3.3 (4 prompts instead of 6) because HFM has no Partner API — the API-dependent automation is replaced by manual admin processes.

## Context for this phase

HFM has confirmed they don't offer public Partner API services. v3.4 routes around this by:

- Building the `BrokerProvider` abstraction (still useful for future broker migrations, even if API methods are skeletons)
- Building a `MockBrokerProvider` for development testing
- Recording user-claimed HFM account numbers without real-time verification
- Handling subscriber reconciliation via admin CSV upload (replaces v3.3's daily Edge Function)
- Removing the two-tier balance gate entirely (it required Partner API access)

The architecture is no longer a compromise. It's the actual industry pattern for AI-strategy services on broker copy-trading platforms (Sonic AI, NEO FX on TAG Markets/CopyX operate this way).

## Prerequisites before starting

1. **Confirm Phase 1 + Phase 2 are committed.** Phase 3 builds against the schema and auth from Phase 1, and the public marketing pages from Phase 2.

2. **Add broker provider config to `.env.local`:**
   ```
   BROKER_PROVIDER=hfm
   HFM_IB_CODE=<your client's actual Partner ID from affiliates.hfm.com>
   ```
   
   **Why hfm and not mock for local development:** in v3.4 the broker integration is genuinely small — only `signupUrl()` does real work; other methods throw "not yet implemented" because HFM has no Partner API. Using `hfm` locally matches production behaviour exactly, generates real referral URLs with your actual IB code, and surfaces any accidental calls to not-yet-implemented methods immediately rather than letting mock data silently mask them. The `MockBrokerProvider` stays in the codebase as a unit-test utility (Vitest tests instantiate it directly) and as an opt-in for specific scenarios where you need to test broker error states without hitting real services.

3. **Update `.env.example`** to include the new variables.

4. **No Finnhub needed for Phase 3.** v3.3 needed Finnhub for FX conversion in the balance gate. v3.4 has no balance gate. Finnhub is still useful for DXY filter (Phase 4) but not needed for Phase 3.

## How to use this document

Run prompts one at a time. Each builds on the previous, but each can be reviewed and committed independently.

**Recommended order:**
1. Prompt 8 — BrokerProvider interface + MockBrokerProvider
2. Prompt 9 — HFMBrokerProvider skeleton
3. Prompt 11 v2 — HFM account number recording
4. Prompt 12 v2 — Admin CSV reconciliation

**Estimated total time:** 6-8 hours of focused work across the four prompts.

---

## Prompt 8 — BrokerProvider interface + MockBrokerProvider

```
Build the BrokerProvider interface and a fully functional MockBrokerProvider implementation for HayPlusbot.

## Architecture

HayPlusbot's broker integration is abstracted behind a TypeScript interface so HFM can be supplemented with other brokers in future. Per CLAUDE.md, all broker-specific code lives in `lib/brokers/` and is never imported elsewhere — non-broker code only ever uses the interface.

The active provider is selected at runtime via the `BROKER_PROVIDER` environment variable. **Default for both development and production is `hfm`** — this gives you a development environment that matches production behaviour. The `MockBrokerProvider` exists as a development utility for specific testing scenarios (and as the test harness for Vitest unit tests) but is not the default for runtime. In v3.4 with HFM, the HFM provider's only fully-implemented method is `signupUrl()`; other methods throw "not yet implemented" because HFM has no Partner API — those throws are correct behaviour, not bugs.

## File structure

```
lib/brokers/
├── types.ts                    # BrokerProvider interface + shared types
├── index.ts                    # Provider factory: returns active impl based on env
├── mock/
│   └── provider.ts             # MockBrokerProvider — used for tests + opt-in dev scenarios
└── hfm/                        # placeholder folder (Prompt 9 fills this in)
    └── .gitkeep
```

## Interface specification

In `lib/brokers/types.ts`, define:

```typescript
// Shared types used by all provider implementations
export interface AccountVerificationResult {
  hfmAccountNumber: string
  exists: boolean
  underOurIbCode: boolean
  ibCode?: string
  accountStatus: 'active' | 'suspended' | 'closed' | 'unknown'
  verifiedAt: Date
}

export interface MasterStrategyMetrics {
  subscribersCount: number
  totalMirrorVolumeLifetime: number
  performanceFees30d: number
  performanceFeesLifetime: number
  syncedAt: Date
}

export interface BrokerProvider {
  /**
   * Provider identifier (mock, hfm, etc.)
   */
  readonly name: string

  /**
   * Generate the broker signup URL with our IB referral code embedded.
   * Used by the landing page and onboarding flow.
   */
  signupUrl(referralToken?: string): string

  /**
   * The following methods exist in the interface for future provider
   * implementations or future API access. In v3.4 with HFM (no Partner API),
   * these throw "not yet implemented" — the operational equivalents
   * happen via manual admin actions instead.
   */
  verifyAccountUnderPartnerCode(
    hfmAccountNumber: string
  ): Promise<AccountVerificationResult>

  getMasterStrategyMetrics(): Promise<MasterStrategyMetrics>

  getActiveHfcopySubscribers(): Promise<string[]>
}
```

## MockBrokerProvider implementation

In `lib/brokers/mock/provider.ts`, build a fully functional implementation:

- Returns realistic, deterministic responses
- Simulates latency (50-200ms per call)
- Logs every call with `[MockBrokerProvider]` prefix

### Behaviour rules:

**`verifyAccountUnderPartnerCode(hfmAccountNumber)`:**
- Account numbers starting with "1" → `exists: true, underOurIbCode: true, accountStatus: 'active'`
- Account numbers starting with "2" → `exists: true, underOurIbCode: false, ibCode: 'OTHER123', accountStatus: 'active'`
- Account numbers starting with "9" → `exists: false, accountStatus: 'unknown'`
- All other prefixes → same as "1" (default to passing)

**`getMasterStrategyMetrics()`:**
- subscribersCount: 0 (will increase to 247 once 50+ threshold met for displays)
- totalMirrorVolumeLifetime: 0
- performanceFees30d: 0
- performanceFeesLifetime: 0
- syncedAt: current timestamp
- Comment explains: change `subscribersCount` to 247 manually for testing the widget appearance

**`getActiveHfcopySubscribers()`:**
- Returns empty array `[]` by default
- Comment explains: in v3.4 production, this list comes from admin CSV upload, not API

**`signupUrl(referralToken)`:**
- Returns `https://register.hfm.com/?refid=MOCK_IB_CODE&ref=${referralToken || ''}`

## Provider factory in `lib/brokers/index.ts`

```typescript
import { BrokerProvider } from './types'
import { MockBrokerProvider } from './mock/provider'

let cachedProvider: BrokerProvider | null = null

export function getBrokerProvider(): BrokerProvider {
  if (cachedProvider) return cachedProvider

  const providerName = process.env.BROKER_PROVIDER || 'hfm'

  switch (providerName) {
    case 'mock':
      cachedProvider = new MockBrokerProvider()
      break
    case 'hfm':
      // Phase 3 Prompt 9 will fill in the HFM provider import.
      // In v3.4 most HFM provider methods will throw "not yet implemented"
      // since HFM has no Partner API — that is correct behaviour, not a bug.
      throw new Error(
        'HFM provider not yet implemented in this codebase. Run Phase 3 Prompt 9 first.'
      )
    default:
      throw new Error(`Unknown broker provider: ${providerName}`)
  }

  return cachedProvider
}

export type {
  BrokerProvider,
  AccountVerificationResult,
  MasterStrategyMetrics,
} from './types'
```

## Tests

Add Vitest tests at `lib/brokers/mock/provider.test.ts`:

- `verifyAccountUnderPartnerCode` returns expected results for each prefix pattern
- `getMasterStrategyMetrics` returns the seed values
- `signupUrl` includes the referral token correctly when provided
- All methods complete within reasonable latency bounds (under 500ms in test)

## Documentation

Update `docs/architecture.md` (create if doesn't exist) with a "Broker Integration" section explaining:
- The `BrokerProvider` interface pattern
- Why hfm is the default in v3.4 (matches production; mock kept for tests + opt-in dev scenarios)
- How to swap providers via `BROKER_PROVIDER` env var
- Where to add tests when implementing new providers

## Verification before commit

1. `pnpm typecheck` clean
2. `pnpm test` — broker tests pass
3. `pnpm lint` clean
4. Verify `BROKER_PROVIDER=hfm` and `HFM_IB_CODE` set in `.env.local`. If `HFM_IB_CODE` isn't yet known, you can temporarily set `BROKER_PROVIDER=mock` for this prompt's verification, but you'll need to switch to `hfm` once you have the real Partner ID and certainly before Prompt 11 v2.
5. Test all account number patterns (starting with 1, 2, 9) produce expected results

## Suggested commit message

feat: Phase 3 Prompt 8 — BrokerProvider interface + MockBrokerProvider

- BrokerProvider interface with 4 methods (signupUrl plus 3 placeholders)
- MockBrokerProvider with deterministic test data and realistic latency
- Provider factory selects active impl via BROKER_PROVIDER env
- Test patterns: account prefixes 1, 2, 9
- Vitest test coverage for all interface methods
- HFM implementation skeleton folder placeholder (filled in Prompt 9)
- Architecture documented in docs/architecture.md
- v3.4: balance check methods removed (no balance gate)
```

---

## Prompt 9 — HFMBrokerProvider skeleton

```
Build the HFMBrokerProvider skeleton in `lib/brokers/hfm/`. HFM does not offer a public Partner API, so the API-dependent methods throw "not yet implemented" errors. The skeleton exists for code organisation discipline and against the possibility that HFM offers an API in future.

## File structure

```
lib/brokers/hfm/
├── provider.ts              # HFMBrokerProvider implementing BrokerProvider
└── README.md                # Setup instructions; documents the no-API constraint
```

## HFMBrokerProvider implementation

In `lib/brokers/hfm/provider.ts`:

```typescript
import { BrokerProvider, AccountVerificationResult, MasterStrategyMetrics } from '../types'

export interface HFMBrokerProviderConfig {
  ibCode: string
}

export class HFMBrokerProvider implements BrokerProvider {
  readonly name = 'hfm'

  constructor(private config: HFMBrokerProviderConfig) {}

  signupUrl(referralToken?: string): string {
    // This method CAN be implemented — just URL construction
    const url = new URL('https://register.hfm.com/')
    url.searchParams.set('refid', this.config.ibCode)
    if (referralToken) {
      url.searchParams.set('ref', referralToken)
    }
    return url.toString()
  }

  async verifyAccountUnderPartnerCode(
    hfmAccountNumber: string
  ): Promise<AccountVerificationResult> {
    // HFM does not offer a Partner API. Account verification is handled
    // via the manual reconciliation flow at /admin/hfm-sync (Prompt 12 v2).
    // This method exists in the interface for future-compatibility only.
    throw new Error(
      'HFM has no Partner API. Account verification happens via admin CSV ' +
      'reconciliation at /admin/hfm-sync. Do not call this method directly. ' +
      'If HFM ever offers an API, fill in this implementation.'
    )
  }

  async getMasterStrategyMetrics(): Promise<MasterStrategyMetrics> {
    // HFM does not offer a Partner API. Master strategy metrics
    // (specifically subscriber count) are updated manually via admin
    // dashboard at /admin/hfm-sync.
    throw new Error(
      'HFM has no Partner API. Master strategy metrics are managed via ' +
      'admin dashboard manual updates. Do not call this method directly.'
    )
  }

  async getActiveHfcopySubscribers(): Promise<string[]> {
    // HFM does not offer a Partner API. Active subscriber list is uploaded
    // by admin via CSV from HFM Partner Area dashboard.
    throw new Error(
      'HFM has no Partner API. Active subscribers are reconciled via ' +
      'admin CSV upload at /admin/hfm-sync. Do not call this method directly.'
    )
  }
}
```

## Update the provider factory

In `lib/brokers/index.ts`, update the switch statement:

```typescript
case 'hfm':
  const { HFMBrokerProvider } = await import('./hfm/provider')

  const config = {
    ibCode: process.env.HFM_IB_CODE!,
  }

  if (!config.ibCode) {
    throw new Error('Missing HFM_IB_CODE env var for HFMBrokerProvider')
  }

  cachedProvider = new HFMBrokerProvider(config)
  break
```

## README at `lib/brokers/hfm/README.md`

```markdown
# HFMBrokerProvider

This is the production broker implementation for HFM. As of v3.4, HFM does
not offer a public Partner API. The implementation is therefore minimal:

- `signupUrl()` — fully implemented (URL construction with IB referral code)
- All other methods throw "not yet implemented" errors

## Operational equivalents

The functions that would have been API calls in v3.3 are now manual processes:

| v3.3 API method | v3.4 manual equivalent |
|---|---|
| `verifyAccountUnderPartnerCode()` | Admin CSV reconciliation at `/admin/hfm-sync` |
| `getMasterStrategyMetrics()` | Admin manual subscriber count update at `/admin/hfm-sync` |
| `getActiveHfcopySubscribers()` | Same — admin reads from CSV upload |

## Future: if HFM offers a Partner API

If HFM ever announces a public Partner API:

1. Fill in the method implementations using HFM's documented endpoints
2. Add Finnhub or similar FX rate fetching if balance checks are reintroduced
3. Re-evaluate whether to bring back the v3.3 two-tier balance gate
4. Migrate users from manual reconciliation to automated sync

The interface preserves swap-readiness for this scenario.

## Configuration

Required env var: `HFM_IB_CODE` — your client's HFM IB referral code.

Set `BROKER_PROVIDER=hfm` (the default in v3.4) to activate this provider. Use `mock` only for specific test scenarios.
```

## Tests

Add tests at `lib/brokers/hfm/provider.test.ts`:
- HFMBrokerProvider instantiates correctly with valid config
- `signupUrl` produces correct URL format with and without referral token
- All non-`signupUrl` methods throw with the documented "no Partner API" message
- Provider factory throws clear error if `BROKER_PROVIDER=hfm` but `HFM_IB_CODE` missing

## Verification before commit

1. `pnpm typecheck` clean
2. `pnpm test` — all tests pass including new HFM tests
3. `pnpm lint` clean
4. With `BROKER_PROVIDER=hfm` and valid `HFM_IB_CODE`, `signupUrl()` produces the correct URL with the IB code embedded
5. With `BROKER_PROVIDER=hfm` and missing `HFM_IB_CODE`, clear error message appears at app startup
6. With `BROKER_PROVIDER=mock`, app falls back to mock data (this is the opt-in path for testing scenarios)

## Suggested commit message

feat: Phase 3 Prompt 9 — HFMBrokerProvider skeleton

- HFMBrokerProvider implementing BrokerProvider interface
- signupUrl method fully implemented
- Other methods throw "no Partner API" errors with clear messaging
- README documents the v3.4 manual reconciliation pattern
- Provider factory updated to select HFM when BROKER_PROVIDER=hfm
- Test coverage verifies skeleton structural integrity
- v3.4: HFM has no public Partner API; methods preserved for future-compatibility
```

## Prompt 11 v2 — HFM account number recording

```
Build the HFM account number recording step at /subscribe.

This is the first authenticated step of the subscribe flow after disclosure signing. User records their HFM account number; reconciliation against our IB referral list happens via admin manual process (Prompt 12 v2).

In v3.4 there is no real-time API verification (HFM has no Partner API). The user is informed of a 24-48 hour reconciliation cycle.

## Visual reference

Match prototype p17 — subscribe flow page. The success message wording differs from prototype: there's no real-time verification, just acknowledgment of recording.

## Implementation requirements

### Route
- File: `app/(dashboard)/subscribe/page.tsx`
- Server Component for shell, Client Component for the form
- Auth + disclosure-signed middleware
- If user already has `hfm_account_number` recorded: skip to `/subscribe/info` (next page in flow that handles HFcopy handoff)

### Page structure

**Hero:**
- Step indicator: "Step 3 of 4"
- H1: "Connect your HFM account"
- Subhead: "Enter your HFM account number. We'll verify it's registered under our referral within 24-48 hours."

**Form:**
- Input: HFM account number (8-digit numeric, JetBrains Mono in input value)
- Server dropdown: HFM-Real / HFM-Real-Plus / HFM-Real-Pro (default: HFM-Real)
- Primary CTA: "Record account number"
- Below form, tertiary text: "We never ask for your trading password. Your credentials stay with HFM."
- Alternative path link: "Don't have an HFM account yet? Open one through our referral link →"

### Server Action

Create `app/(dashboard)/subscribe/actions.ts`:

```typescript
'use server'

import { z } from 'zod'
import { redirect } from 'next/navigation'
import { revalidatePath } from 'next/cache'
import { createServerClient } from '@/lib/supabase/server'

const RecordSchema = z.object({
  hfmAccountNumber: z.string().regex(/^\d{8}$/, 'Account number must be 8 digits'),
  server: z.enum(['HFM-Real', 'HFM-Real-Plus', 'HFM-Real-Pro']),
})

export async function recordHfmAccount(formData: FormData) {
  const supabase = createServerClient()
  
  const { data: { user }, error: authError } = await supabase.auth.getUser()
  if (authError || !user) {
    return { error: 'Not authenticated', code: 'AUTH_REQUIRED' }
  }

  const parsed = RecordSchema.safeParse({
    hfmAccountNumber: formData.get('hfmAccountNumber'),
    server: formData.get('server'),
  })

  if (!parsed.success) {
    return { error: parsed.error.errors[0].message, code: 'INVALID_INPUT' }
  }

  // Just record the claim — no real-time verification (HFM has no Partner API).
  // Verification happens via admin CSV reconciliation (Prompt 12 v2).
  const { error: updateError } = await supabase
    .from('signups')
    .update({
      hfm_account_number: parsed.data.hfmAccountNumber,
      hfm_account_verified_at: null,
      hfm_account_verified_under_our_code: false,
    })
    .eq('user_id', user.id)

  if (updateError) {
    return { error: 'Database update failed', code: 'DB_ERROR' }
  }

  revalidatePath('/subscribe')
  return { success: true }
}
```

### Client Component (the form)

`components/subscribe/account-recording-form.tsx`:
- Uses React Server Actions via `useFormState` hook
- Loading state during submission
- Conditional rendering based on result code
- After success: show success card, then `setTimeout(() => router.push('/subscribe/info'), 2500)`
- All visual styling matches the prototype

### Success state

After successful recording, show success card:
- Heading: "Account number recorded ✓"
- Body text: "We'll verify your account is under our referral within 24-48 hours via our daily reconciliation. You'll receive an email once confirmed, after which you can complete your HFcopy subscription on HFM's platform."
- Auto-redirect to /subscribe/info after 2.5 seconds

### /subscribe/info page (post-recording handoff)

Create `app/(dashboard)/subscribe/info/page.tsx`. This is the page users land on after recording their account number. Key contents:

- H1: "Your HFcopy subscription"
- Status card showing verification state ("Verification pending — typically 24-48 hours")
- Subscription summary card with strategy details, recommended minimum ($100 USD equivalent guidance only — no enforcement), pairs, sessions
- Primary CTA: "Open HFcopy subscription on HFM →" (deep link to HFM's HFcopy strategy URL)
- Body text: "You can complete your HFcopy subscription on HFM's platform now. Your dashboard here will reflect your subscription within 24-48 hours after our next reconciliation."
- Section explaining what happens next:
  - "1. We verify your HFM account is under our referral (24-48 hours)"
  - "2. We confirm via email"
  - "3. Your HayPlusbot dashboard updates to show your subscription status"
- Note: "If you're already subscribed on HFcopy, your trades start mirroring as soon as HFM activates the subscription on their side — that's separate from our verification timing."

### Tests

`app/(dashboard)/subscribe/actions.test.ts`:
- Schema validation rejects non-8-digit account numbers
- Schema validation rejects invalid servers
- Successfully recording updates the signups row with correct values (verified flags = false)
- Re-recording overwrites previous value (allowing user to correct mistakes)
- Unauthenticated user → AUTH_REQUIRED error

### Verification before commit

1. Visit /subscribe authenticated + disclosure-signed
2. Enter "10054472", server HFM-Real, submit → success card appears, then redirects to /subscribe/info
3. Refresh /subscribe — redirects to /subscribe/info (already recorded)
4. Test invalid format (less than 8 digits) — form validation catches
5. Test re-submission with different number — overwrites previous
6. /subscribe/info shows verification-pending state
7. `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm test` clean

### Suggested commit message

feat: Phase 3 Prompt 11 v2 — HFM account number recording

- /subscribe records claimed HFM account number to signups
- No real-time API verification (HFM has no Partner API)
- /subscribe/info shows post-recording handoff with verification-pending state
- HFcopy subscription deep link for users to subscribe on HFM
- User informed of 24-48 hour reconciliation cycle
- Sets hfm_account_verified_under_our_code = false until admin reconciles
- Form validation, error handling, success state per prototype p17
- v3.4: replaces v3.3's real-time verification with manual reconciliation
```

---

## Prompt 12 v2 — Admin CSV reconciliation action

```
Build the admin CSV upload feature for reconciling HFM subscriber lists against HayPlusbot signups.

This replaces v3.3's automated daily Edge Function. Admin manually exports the referred-clients CSV from HFM Partner Area dashboard and uploads it here for reconciliation.

## Page

File: `app/(admin)/hfm-sync/page.tsx`
Auth: `requireAdmin()` middleware
Layout: matches admin dashboard pattern from prototype p16

## Add dependencies

`pnpm add papaparse @types/papaparse`

## UI sections

### Section A — Subscriber Reconciliation
- H2: "Subscriber Reconciliation"
- Body: "Upload the referred-clients CSV from HFM Partner Area to reconcile against HayPlusbot signups."
- Drag-and-drop upload zone (or file input fallback for keyboard accessibility)
- Help text: "Expected CSV columns: account_number, status, registration_date. Other columns ignored. File must be .csv, under 10MB."
- "Process upload" button (disabled until file uploaded)

### After processing — show summary card
- Total accounts in upload: N
- Active accounts (status = 'active'): M
- Newly verified (HayPlusbot user matched HFM list, was not yet verified): X
- Newly subscribed (matched + was not previously subscribed): Y
- Newly unsubscribed (was subscribed, no longer in HFM list): Z
- Already subscribed, still on list (unchanged): W
- Unmatched HayPlusbot users (claimed account not in upload): V with expandable list

### Section B — Manual unmatched user follow-up
For each unmatched HayPlusbot user:
- Email address (truncated for privacy: `j***@example.com`)
- Their claimed HFM account number
- "Send verification email" button (sends standardised email asking them to confirm account or reopen via referral)
- "Mark as ignored" option (admin discretion if user is known dropoff)

### Section C — Subscriber Count Update
- Current displayed count: shows `hfm_sync_state.subscribers_count`
- Input: new count (numeric, non-negative)
- Reason note (required for audit log): textarea, min 3 chars
- "Update count" button → writes to `hfm_sync_state` and `admin_action_log`

## Server Actions

Create `app/(admin)/hfm-sync/actions.ts`:

```typescript
'use server'

import { requireAdmin } from '@/lib/auth/require-admin'
import { logAdminAction } from '@/lib/admin/audit'
import { createServiceClient } from '@/lib/supabase/service'
import Papa from 'papaparse'

  if (!file) return { error: 'No file uploaded' }
  if (file.size > 10 * 1024 * 1024) return { error: 'File too large (max 10MB)' }
  
  const text = await file.text()
  const parsed = Papa.parse<any>(text, { header: true, skipEmptyLines: true })
  
  if (parsed.errors.length > 0) {
    return { error: 'CSV parsing failed: ' + parsed.errors[0].message }
  }
  
  // Validate required column
  const firstRow = parsed.data[0]
  if (!firstRow || !('account_number' in firstRow)) {
    return { error: 'CSV missing required column: account_number' }
  }
  
  // Extract active account numbers
  const accountNumbers = new Set<string>(
    parsed.data
      .filter(row => !row.status || row.status?.toLowerCase() === 'active')
      .map(row => row.account_number?.toString().trim())
      .filter(Boolean)
  )
  
  const supabase = createServiceClient()
  
  // Fetch all HayPlusbot signups with HFM account numbers
  const { data: signups, error: fetchError } = await supabase
    .from('signups')
    .select('id, user_id, email, hfm_account_number, hfcopy_subscribed, hfm_account_verified_under_our_code')
    .not('hfm_account_number', 'is', null)
  
  if (fetchError) return { error: 'Database fetch failed: ' + fetchError.message }
  
  let newlyVerified = 0
  let newlySubscribed = 0
  let newlyUnsubscribed = 0
  let alreadySubscribed = 0
  const unmatchedUsers: { id: string; email: string; account: string }[] = []
  
  for (const signup of signups || []) {
    const onHfmList = accountNumbers.has(signup.hfm_account_number!)

## Tests

Create `app/(admin)/hfm-sync/actions.test.ts`:

- Upload sample CSV with 5 accounts (3 active, 2 inactive)
- Verify only active accounts are processed
- Verify newly_subscribed count is correct when previously unsubscribed user matches
- Verify newly_verified count is correct
- Verify newly_unsubscribed when previously subscribed user removed from list
- Verify unmatched users are listed correctly with masked emails
- Verify admin_action_log row created with correct metadata
- Test malformed CSV produces clear error
- Test missing required column (account_number) produces clear error
- Test file size validation (>10MB rejected)
- updateSubscriberCount validates inputs and creates audit log
- updateSubscriberCount rejects negative counts and short reason notes

## Verification before commit

1. Create a sample CSV with mixed account states (3 matching HayPlusbot users, 2 not, 1 inactive)
2. Upload via admin dashboard at /admin/hfm-sync
3. Verify summary numbers are correct
4. Verify signups rows updated correctly in DB
5. Check admin_action_log captures the reconciliation action with all metadata
6. Test subscriber count update with valid and invalid inputs
7. Test malformed CSV produces sensible error message
8. Test the unmatched-user follow-up flow (clicking "Send verification email" logs the action)
9. `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm test` clean

## Suggested commit message

feat: Phase 3 Prompt 12 v2 — admin CSV subscriber reconciliation

- /admin/hfm-sync page with CSV upload and reconciliation
- Replaces v3.3's automated daily Edge Function (HFM has no Partner API)
- CSV parsing via papaparse with size and column validation
- Reconciles signups.hfcopy_subscribed against HFM's exported list
- Identifies newly-verified, newly-subscribed, newly-unsubscribed, unmatched
- Email masking for privacy in unmatched users list
- Manual subscriber count update with audit logging
- Welcome email and unmatched-user follow-up TODO for Phase 7 Resend
- Per audit pattern: every action logs to admin_action_log with full metadata
- File size limit 10MB; CSV only; service-role-only access
```

---

## After Phase 3 v2 is complete

Once all four prompts are committed and pushed, you'll have:

- A working broker abstraction with mock and HFM-skeleton implementations
- The full subscribe flow including account number recording (no balance gate)
- Admin CSV reconciliation infrastructure for v3.4's manual verification model
- Audit trail for every reconciliation action

**What's still pending external dependencies:**

1. HFM strategy provider authorisation completion → required to actually launch the master strategy on HFcopy
2. MetaAPI.cloud subscription → needed for Phase 4 (signal engine connecting to master account)
3. Trading Economics API account → needed for Phase 4 (economic calendar filter)
4. Finnhub free API key → needed for Phase 4 (DXY filter, news)
5. Nigerian solicitor review → recommended before launch

**Next: Phase 4 (signal engine and bot worker).**

When you're through Phase 3 v2, message me. We'll plan Phase 4 properly. Phase 4 is where the SMC/ICT methodology becomes TypeScript code that runs against live market data and executes trades on the master account via MetaAPI.

## What if Claude Code asks clarifying questions

Some Phase 3 prompts produce questions because the prompt makes assumptions about your auth structure or Supabase service client setup. If asked, the answers are usually:

- "Service client" → `createServiceClient()` from `lib/supabase/service.ts` using `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- "Server client" → `createServerClient()` from `lib/supabase/server.ts` for user-context queries
- "Admin auth helper" → `requireAdmin()` from `lib/auth/require-admin.ts` (built in Phase 1 / Prompt 25 if not yet)

If your Phase 1 didn't create `requireAdmin()` yet (it's planned for Phase 6 Prompt 25), you can either:
- Add a temporary local helper in the actions file for now
- Defer the admin reconciliation page until Phase 6 is built and come back to it

The cleanest approach is the second — Phase 3 builds the broker abstraction and account recording (which don't need admin), then Phase 6 adds the admin layer including the reconciliation UI built against the same actions.

If that's preferred, treat Prompt 12 v2 above as "build the actions and tests now in `lib/admin/reconciliation.ts`; the UI page comes later in Phase 6."
